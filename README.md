# Clean CaDET Overview
The vision and idea behind Clean CaDET is described in this [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBENFfjC49A).

Clean CaDET started as a project funded by the [Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia](http://fondzanauku.gov.rs/?lang=en). It hopes to grow into an active open-source community dedicated to software engineers' growth and their pursuit to build sustainable, high-quality software.
