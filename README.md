# Clean CaDET Overview

Clean CaDET started as a project funded by the [Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia](http://fondzanauku.gov.rs/?lang=en). It hopes to grow into an active open-source community dedicated to software engineers' growth and their pursuit to build sustainable, high-quality software.
